p. Filters documents to include only fields containing a term (i.e. an exact match.)  Similar to "term query":/guide/reference/query-dsl/term-query.html, except that it acts as a filter. Can be placed within queries that accept a filter, for example:

p. This only works for fields that have defined "index":"not_analyzed" in their mappings.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "constant_score" : {
        "filter" : {
            "term" : { "user" : "kimchy"}
        }
    }
}
</pre>

h1. Caching

p. The result of the filter is automatically cached by default. The `_cache` can be set to `false` to turn it off. Here is an example:


<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "constant_score" : {
        "filter" : {
            "term" : { 
                "user" : "kimchy",
                "_cache" : false
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>
